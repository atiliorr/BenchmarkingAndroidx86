Benchmarking Androidx86
======================

The idea of benchmarking an Amazon instance with Dalvik x86 is to find out the level of concurrency that can be achieved in computational offloading. 

Dalvik x86 can be created by following these scripts, we encourage to use AOSP code [script 1](),https://gist.github.com/huberflores/4687766) [script 2](https://gist.github.com/huberflores/4714824)

Alternatively, we can provide you with an Amazon Android x86 image
